## ChantMapper

The `Gregorian_chant_repertoire` folder contains an application programmed in the Django framework. It is a tool for musicologists to help them with exploring the results of a computational search for repertoire traditions within Gregorian chant.

It has been deployed already and curently lives here: [https://dominant-highly-bluejay.ngrok-free.app/map_repertoire/](https://dominant-highly-bluejay.ngrok-free.app/map_repertoire/)  

In order to run the application on local, Python (version 3.11.6) as well as its libraries listed in `app_requirements.txt` file must be installed.
